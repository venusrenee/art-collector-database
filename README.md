# art-collector-database
Java project to emulate an art collection database. The "collector" class details information about the buyers and sellers of the art, the "transaction" class includes information about transactions involving any piece of art, and the "transactionDB" class maintains information about a collection of transactions and provides a summary of information about them. 
Please Note! "TestTransactions" was given by my professor, Andrew Karem, as a prompt/guide and for formatting purposes for the rest of the project. Collector.java, Transaction.java, and TransactionDB.java were all created by me. TestTransactions.java is included because it houses the main function.
